# Hi! üê∫

This is my blog, it is powered by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and themed by [Gungnir](https://github.com/Renovamen/vuepress-theme-gungnir).

My blog used to be built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (see the [`jekyll`](https://github.com/Renovamen/renovamen.github.io/tree/jekyll) branch). The Jekyll version of theme Gungnir is avalible [here](https://github.com/Renovamen/jekyll-theme-gungnir).

Any way, just have fun with this blog: https://renovamen.ink
