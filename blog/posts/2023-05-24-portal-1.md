What if Neuro had her own laboratory in the world of Portal? While keeping the original storyline intact, this mod introduces Neuro-sama into the game, adding a touch of her unique personality and style.

## Description

In this mod, Neuro-sama takes GladOs place. It's very difficult to replicate the emotion and the tone of the voice actress of GladOs, but I've tried my best to not make it dull either.

Aperture Science has also been updated with "Fun AI Laboratories", which lines up with Neuro better. This affects both visuals and the voice lines.

The portals and portal gun have also been altered. Portals now use pink (although the game engine seems to render them more magenta) and green, colors more inline with Neuro-sama.
