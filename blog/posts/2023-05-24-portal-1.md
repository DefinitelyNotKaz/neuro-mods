What if Neuro ran her own Lab.

<!-- more -->

## Description

This mod themes Portal 1 around Neuro-sama. It doesn't change the story, rewrite the voice lines (excluding adding wink/heart/filtered)

## GladOs

GladOs voice has been replaced by Neuro-sama as well as I was able, although GladOs has a robotic voice, she was voiced by a human, so in many lines it has emotion that I cant replicated with Text-To-Speech.

## Aperture Science
Most of the graphics mentioning Aperture Science have been replaced by Fun AI, a more appropiate name for something Neuro would run.
Mentions to Aperture in the GladOs voice lines have also been changed.

## Portals
Portals and the portal gun have been changed to use Pink/Magenta (It's set as pink but the engine renders it more magenta) and Green as portal colors.

## Download

::: warning
This mod isn't compatible with Portal in RTX currently.
